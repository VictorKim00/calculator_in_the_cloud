Computer Networking HW1 – Java Socket Calculator 

This project implements a **client-server calculator** application using **Java TCP sockets**.  
The goal is to understand socket communication, multithreaded server design, and application-layer protocol definition.

### Objectives
- Build an **Internet calculator** using Java Socket API  
- Support basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)  
- Handle multiple clients simultaneously using **ThreadPool**  
- Define a custom **ASCII-based protocol** inspired by HTTP  
- Load server configuration (`server_info.dat`) dynamically in the client
